# MLflow Integration for Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the MLflow integration guide! This project demonstrates how to incorporate MLflow into your machine learning workflows for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment.

## Overview

MLflow is an open-source platform designed to streamline the machine learning lifecycle:
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, code versions, metrics, and artifacts.
- **Project Packaging**: Reproduce runs with packaged code.
- **Model Management**: Register, deploy, and manage models seamlessly.
- **Model Deployment**: Serve models with standardized APIs for production.

## Features

- Easy setup of MLflow tracking server
- Logging experiments and hyperparameters
- Comparing different model runs visually
- Saving and deploying models directly from MLflow
- Integration with popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- MLflow library
- Other dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Virtual Environment
Create Virtual Environment with Conda

```python
conda create -n mlflow-venv python=3.12
```

```python
conda activate mlflow-venv
```
